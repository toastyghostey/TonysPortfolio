				<h3>MAY 20th: BIRD-BRAINED BITS</h3>

				<div class="textboxText">
					<p>As I sat in the park, observing the tranquil scene before me, I noticed a peculiar individual engaged in a seemingly innocuous activity: feeding the birds. The man, likely in his late 50s, was scattering breadcrumbs on the grass, his eyes fixed on the fluttering sparrows. At first glance, the scene appeared idyllic, a gentle soul communing with nature. However, as I continued to watch, I detected a subtle undercurrent of performance, a deliberate attempt to create a spectacle. It was as if the man was "phoning it in," feeding the birds not out of genuine affection, but rather to craft a humorous bit. </p>
					<p>Consider the following evidence:</p>
						<div class="textboxList">
							<ul>
								<li><b>Exaggerated gestures:</b> The man's movements were theatrical, his arm sweeping across the air as he scattered the breadcrumbs. This flamboyant motion was unnecessary, as the birds could have been easily fed with a more subdued</li>
								<li><b>Self-conscious glances:</b> As the man fed the birds, he periodically looked around, seemingly checking to see if anyone was watching. This behavior suggests that he was aware of the performative nature of his actions, and was gauging the reaction of his (non-existent) audience</li>
								<li><b>Over-the-top enthusiasm:</b> The man's reactions to the birds' presence were comically exaggerated. He would exclaim <i>"Oh, look! A sparrow!"</i> or <i>"Oh, isn't he beautiful?"</i> in a tone that was almost... rehearsed. This affected enthusiasm was a clear indication that he was "phoning it in," playing the role of the eccentric bird enthusiast for the sake of entertainment.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					<p>But what if I'm wrong? What if the man was simply a genuine bird enthusiast, enjoying the simple pleasure of feeding the birds? I propose that even if this were the case, the man's actions would still be influenced by the "Phoning it In" conspiracy. In our modern, social media-driven world, even the most mundane activities are performed with an awareness of potential audiences. We are all, to some extent, "phoning it in," curating our actions to create a desirable image or narrative.</p>
					<p>In the case of the bird feeder, his actions may have started as a genuine hobby, but over time, he may have become aware of the comedic potential of his actions. He may have begun to exaggerate his gestures, reactions, and language to create a humorous "bit" â€“ a performance that is both entertaining and relatable.</p>
