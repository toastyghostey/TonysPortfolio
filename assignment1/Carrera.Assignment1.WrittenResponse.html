			<p>As I was reading Wagner’s essay, I found myself nodding along more and more to how she reminisces about the old internet. I myself am only twenty four - much younger than Wagner and many who lived during the pre-9/11 internet, however still I believe I was still in some form of golden age, whatever did leak past. </p>
		
			<p>I’d like to explicitly touch on what she wrote about nostalgia and the web and how it is both decontextualized and at the same time discarded. I believe that there is massive merit to her idea, especially when she writes “(old internet gifs are) lo-res, imperfect, and entirely decontextualized. These disembodied ghosts—ancient in computer years—blink back at me because tech companies know that, based on my age, I like them. And I do like them. I miss where they came from—it’s a place I’ve found is no longer there” of her experience looking for images to accompany her article and her posts of her writing the article on instagram. Having grown up with a computer in my house as early as three years old, I remember hours of surfing the web with my older brother and seeing these gifs posted in earnest – gifs of cool skeletons with flames or a rudimentary 3D rendering of some emoji repetitively flipping the bird. It's interesting to remember this old internet because those gifs were posted entirely in earnest - there was no idea of aesthetic or unified “look” for the internet or what it should be, the pure fact of it being a digital artifact made it “internet” enough. </p>
	
			<p>Now as we see and think of the internet, it's almost married to those old gifs and a sort of purposeful “tackiness” that we understand in the brain should mean “internet”; digital artifacts in the literal sense. As in real life, these artifacts are sought to be preserved or produced. In our flesh-and-blood experience of the world, we have anthropologists, historians, and archeologists tirelessly working to preserve previous cultures of the world to further an understanding of our own. These experts exist for our digital experience of the world, but it is a freshly budding profession. Much of the old web is gone, this is an inscrutable fact - there are websites which I knew to visit religiously that were gone way before the Internet Wayback Machine was even around, and even more contemporary pages gone that simply no one cared at the time to archive. One aspect that Wagner writes is not forgotten is the technological history of the internet, how it came to be; how companies worked towards their current day and what technologies were used, and yet Wagner still quotes an artist named Olia Lialina saying “... we’ve studied the history of hypertext, but not the history of Metallica fan web rings or web rings in general”. </p>
	
			<p>It is that quote that I believe is the most provocative to me in Wagner’s article. Lialina documents many Geocities websites, studying “digital folklore” in an effort to preserve a culture that, although does not exist in any physical way, still nonetheless existed. I believe that, for the sole merit that it was a culture in the first place, one that I and many did exist to witness, and many more existed to birth and shape the practices and rituals, that the old experiences of the web deserve to be preserved. It is not enough to get facsimile of the old internet via genres like Vaporwave or games like Hypnospace Outlaw, as good of a replica as those may be - the personal words of random internet users should be just as important to us as the corporations that attempt to sell us that same nostalgia. </p>
		
			<p>Wagner calls it internet cannibalism - the idea of the internet eating itself and effectively defecating that same material with its original form intact but changed in purpose. I agree to her interpretation, I just hope that we are not too late to get the beast to regurgitate and bring back all its ate - meaning, purpose, and cool skeleton gifs on a random geocity page. </p>
