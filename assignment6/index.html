		<h2>"Mid Boss Isn't Worth It"</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p><i>The following is a post from r/DeadlockTheGame, a subreddit on the website Reddit where users discuss the popular online game, Deadlock.</i></p>
		<p>I was playing a ranked game of deadlock earlier, both teams were very close and we’d just won a small fight putting them 2 players down and all their walkers were down so I made the call out to go mid boss, half way through fighting midboss I realised it was taking to long allowing the enemies to re-spawn we killed 1 of them but we had to leave mid boss at half health allowing them to kill it and quickly snow ball into a win 5 minutes later. Looking back on it we probably could have gone for game and won if I didn’t make the call out to go mid. I just want to hear from higher level players if the Midboss generally isn’t worth it it’s just because we didn’t dps it fast enough.</p>
		<p>TLDR: is it better to just go for game or take midboss?</p>

		<p>Mid-boss is a highly value and high risk target to take at any point in the game, however no single mechanic within the game has the power to completely turn the tides. It is paramount to grab Mid-Boss whenever the chance is available (barring an already weakened Patron) even if you do not need the boon granted by Mid-Boss, as you will be denying that same boon to the enemy team. If the enemy secures the Mid-Boss boon, then it's very easy and very likely that they will be able to push multiple lanes both actively and passively. Deadlock is a game all about comebacks, and a part of that meta-game of comeback and capture is denying the enemy team the capability to do the same to you. </p>
