				<p>Ah, dear seeker of truth, welcome to the rabbit hole. You've stumbled upon the most profound, the most earth-shattering, the most mind-blowing conspiracy of our time. It's not about aliens, or government cover-ups, or Illuminati puppet masters. No, my friend, it's about something much more sinister, much more insidious. It's about the fact that <b>EVERYONE IS FAKING IT.</b>
					</p>
				<p>You see, the "Phoning It In" conspiracy is a web of deceit that permeates every aspect of our lives. It's a collective charade, a grand illusion that we're all participating in, whether we realize it or not. It's the notion that everyone, from the highest echelons of power to the humblest of civilians, is putting on a show. They're all "phoning it in," pretending to be something they're not, playing a role, reciting lines, and going through the motions.
