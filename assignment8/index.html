		<h2>What is Deadlock TOASTED?</h2>
		<p><b>Deadlock</b> is a multiplayer game created by Valve Software that falls into the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre, a type of game where you pick a character with a specialized toolset (often called a champion or in this case a Hero) and you use this character on a large map to destroy an enemy team's base and defenses in an effort to destroy their flagship monster &mdash; in Deadlock, this takes the form of a mysterious all-powerful entity known as "The Patron"
			</p>	
		<p><i>Deadlock TOASTED</i> is a currently on-going mod project between myself and a friend to replace the currently existing in-game icons with cartoony versions of the Heroes that I have illustrated, that as well are reactive to changes in the game &mdash; namely when the character is defeated in combat. Below are three examples of the characters normal icon, and their defeated icon with a brief explanation.
